# Best Practices: Column Header Management in Power Query

When importing and transforming data from files that include variable values (e.g., dates) in the first row, **avoiding** the **Use First Row as Headers** step can prevent unstable column names. Instead, explicitly **rename** generic column placeholders to stable, semantic names.

## Why Not *Use First Row as Headers*?
- **Variable Headers**: If your first data row contains a date or other changing value (e.g., `2025.03.01`), applying *Use First Row as Headers* will turn that value into your column names.
- **Monthly Data**: When the dataset updates (e.g., from March 1 to April 1), headers will change each month, breaking your queries, visuals, and measures.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: You must re-apply or update your header step every time the data source changes format.

## Recommended Approach: Explicitly Rename Columns
1. **Skip** the *Use First Row as Headers* step in your main query.  
2. After expanding your helper table, keep the generic column names (`Column1`, `Column2`, etc.).  
3. Use **Table.RenameColumns** (or the UI â–¶ Rename Columns) to map each placeholder to a meaningful name:
   ```m
   #"Renamed Columns" = Table.RenameColumns(
       #"Previous Step",
       {
         {"Column2", "Employee ID"},
         {"Column3", "Employee Name"},
         {"Column4", "Epic ID"},
         {"Column5", "Designation"},
         {"Column6", "Priority"}
         // add other mappings here
       }
   )
4. **Set Data Types** explicitly after renaming, ensuring each column has the correct type (e.g., `Int64.Type`, `type text`, `type date`).

5. **Close & Apply** to load your stable, semantically named table into Power BI.

## Benefits

- **Consistency**: Column names remain constant, regardless of the actual data values in the first row.
- **Reliability**: No more broken queries when file formats or initial rows change.
- **Clarity**: Semantic names improve readability of M code, making maintenance easier.
