## üîç Overview

This project automates the daily consolidation of CDR extracts by:

1. Prompting the user to select one or more `.txt` files via a GUI file picker.  
2. Reading all files as text to preserve data fidelity.  
3. Concatenating them into a single pandas DataFrame.  
4. Exporting the combined data as a tab-delimited `.txt` file for seamless Power BI loading.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive File Selection** ‚Äì Leverages Tkinter‚Äôs file dialog.  
- **Data Integrity** ‚Äì Forces `dtype=str` to prevent type coercion.  
- **Performance** ‚Äì Batch loads with `pd.concat()` for speed.  
- **BI-Friendly Output** ‚Äì Exports with `\t` delimiter for native Power BI support.  
- **Console Logging** ‚Äì Real-time progress and row counts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- pandas  
- tkinter (usually included with standard Python)  

Install required packages via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
```
